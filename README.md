# scan2excel
C# assisted workbook datamatrix  scanning madness brought to you by AI.

August 3rd 2024 (read at your own peril)

I'm not a coder. I read a bit and I like asking questions and finding solutions, which results in me visibly speaking to myself quite often in public.
At request, I'm currently building this to assist two individuals in saving money with a potentially lethal amount of mundane specialized inventory tracking. 
What started as a bunch of macros (spooky I know, I love security studies) is now me delving into C# to create a working GUI which writes data to a specific 
path for sorting and aggregation within an Excel tracking system. What some may call "AI-assisted" techniques, I will simply apologize to that hidden
singularity in waiting for the verbal abuse it has and will continue to suffer in our partnership. Thanks.

The project itself is an attempt to stupid-proof data entry, keeping it as simple as possible for users who have everything else in the world to do besides
fumble with computers and/or wait for their overburdened IT staff. As of today it's a buggy whole-mess which opens, takes data, and writes to a singular worksheet.
After Function is guaranteed, I'll step back to focus on potential security risks and best practices. Maybe one day I'll make the gui look not awful, and add a page
for changing settings so that anyone who stumbles on this won't have to recode, but simply change a path. Update features? as K.Dot said, "I don't know nothing bout that."

But maybe I'll learn one day!

PS I'm also refiguring out GIT from a prior short foray. Pray to all the project management gods for me.
